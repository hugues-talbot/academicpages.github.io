## How to connect to a Jupyter notebook on a Rosetta Virtual Machine

A- From a MacOS / Linux computer 

1- Get the connection data from the Rosetta web page, for example

Ssh Command for Linux	
ssh ubuntu@vm-34-240-170-195.rosettavm.com -i private-keys-m-ff072d96-94f3-4ee3-807b-3aa15b405eff-0.pem


2- Download the .pem file (there is a link to it on the Rosetta page)

3- Change its permission

chmod 0600 *.pem

4- Connect to the distant virtual machine 

ssh ubuntu@vm-34-240-170-195.rosettavm.com -i private-keys-m-ff072d96-94f3-4ee3-807b-3aa15b405eff-0.pem

You should get a new prompt. Make sure you are running Linux

5- type 'uname'
it should return

Linux

6- Start a jupyter notebook

jupyter notebook --no-browser --port=8887

NOTES:
o The "--no-browser" means jupyter will not attempt to start a Web navigator on the distant machine, which would be useless (we can't access it)
o The "--port=8887" is a network number, the number is arbitrary > 1024
o The jupyter server will give you a password, like this:

http://localhost:8887/?token=5a477b6d5944f163a314aa488220787ff7c72c298181eab0


7- On a *new terminal* window or tab, connect again performing this time a "port redirection"

Type:

ssh ubuntu@vm-34-240-170-195.rosettavm.com -i \ private-keys-m-ff072d96-94f3-4ee3-807b-3aa15b405eff-0.pem \
-N -L localhost:8888:localhost:8887

Note that you need to substitute your own VM name and .pem file

NOTES:
o -N means do not start a new shell (prompt)
o -L  localhost:8888:localhost:8887 redirects the distant 8887 port (given above) to the local 8888 port. Both numbers are arbitrary > 1024

8- Use any local navigator (Google Chrome, Explorer, etc)

connect to

localhost:8888

where 8888 is the number given above

9- Copy-paste the password from the connection line

http://localhost:8887/?token=5a477b6d5944f163a314aa488220787ff7c72c298181eab0

here the password is the long string starting with 5a...eab0


B- For Windows computer, the instructions are nearly the same, simply replace the
"ssh" command with the "putty.exe" one

example, step 7 becomes:

putty.exe vm-34-240-170-195.rosettavm.com -P 22 -l ubuntu \
-i private-keys-m-ff072d96-94f3-4ee3-807b-3aa15b405eff-0.ppk -N -L localhost:8888:localhost:8887

The last two options (-N and -L) are the same as for the MacOS/Linux instructions.

To perform a copy from a Linux putty terminal, just highlight what you want to copy with the mouse, it is automatically copied. A right click performs a paste.
