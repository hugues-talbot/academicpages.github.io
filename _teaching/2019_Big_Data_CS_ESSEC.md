Big Data - Distributed computing and databases
----------------------------------------------

Big Data is more than a buzzword, it is a set of distributed computing
techniques allowing developers to solve practical problems at a scale
commensurable with that of the entire Internet. It forms the basis of
the fortune of the very large Web era multinationals: Google, Amazon,
Facebook.

In this course, we learn the frameworks of Big Data, what it really
represents, how this comes together works with a functional outlook
work: very large databases with HDFS, distributed computing with
Hadoop and Spark. We leverage cloud computing and build simple,
practical, but large-scale software suitable for computing clusters
such as PageRank.

Help

Throughout the course, support, help, videos, supplementary material, further examples and general communication is
supported on a Slack Workspace.
