Image Segmentation
===============

This is a one-off lecture on image segmentation. Image segmentation is
the art/science of delineating objects in images (in 2D/3D etc). It is
similar in some ways to classification in machine learning. However,
image segmentation implies a high degree of spatial coherence, which
is not commonly expected of other data.

In this lecture I will introduce some of the methods used in image segmentation.
