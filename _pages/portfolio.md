present projects I have been involved with

### Recent projects

* The ANR [Vivabrain](http://icube-vivabrain.unistra.fr/index.php/Home) project.
* The ANR GraphSIP project . This stands for
[Graph Signal Processing](https://graphsip.greyc.fr). The objective of
this project is to develop signal processing on graphs, particularly
in large datasets.

* The ANR CoMeDIC project. This stands for
[Converging Metrics in Discrete Calculus](https://www.lama.univ-smb.fr/comedic/)

* The ERC [ITN SUNDIAL](https://www.astro.rug.nl/~sundial/)
  project. This project involves AI, big data and astronomy ! The
  objective of this project is to bring automation to many processes
  in the science of astronomy, particularly for discovering very low

### Software

I'm constantly writing some software, here are some repository for
general use for software I've been involved with.

* The [Imview](https://sourceforge.net/projects/imview/) image
  viewer written in C++. This is a scientific viewer for Windows, Linux and MacOS. I
  wrote this essentially between 1997 and 2014, It is part of the
  Debian project. 

* The [PINK](http://ibipio.hu/joomla/) image processing library. See also this
  link:
  [Pink documentation](https://perso.esiee.fr/~coupriem/Pink/doc/html/index.html).

This C/C++ library includes many algorithms in digital geometry, digital
topology and mathematical morphology.

* The [DGTAL](https://dgtal.org/) library, a powerful digital geometry
  library. This library in C++
