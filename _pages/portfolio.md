In this section I shall post some interesting links to a few past and
present projects I have been involved with

### Recent projects

* The ANR
  [Vivabrain](http://icube-vivabrain.unistra.fr/index.php/Home)
  project. The [RORPO](http://path-openings.github.io/RORPO/) operator was a useful contribution from this project.

These videos show the results of this operator for detecting blood
vessels in the brain and in the heart:

* The ANR GraphSIP project . This stands for
[Graph Signal Processing](https://graphsip.greyc.fr). The objective of
this project is to develop signal processing on graphs, particularly
in large datasets.

* The ANR CoMeDIC project. This stands for
[Converging Metrics in Discrete Calculus](https://www.lama.univ-smb.fr/comedic/)

* The ERC [ITN SUNDIAL](https://www.astro.rug.nl/~sundial/)
  project. This project involves AI, big data and astronomy ! The
  objective of this project is to bring automation to many processes
  in the science of astronomy, particularly for discovering very low
  surface brightness objects. This has implications for dark matter
  theories.

This beautiful image is of a very low surface brightness galaxy. It was
thought to have an unusually low Dark Matter content, although our
project helped establish that it may actually be fairly normal. The
inset is from the Hubble space telescope.

### Software

I'm constantly writing some software, here are some repository for
general use for software I've been involved with.

* The [Imview](https://sourceforge.net/projects/imview/) image
  viewer written in C++. This is a scientific viewer for Windows, Linux and MacOS. I
  wrote this essentially between 1997 and 2014, It is part of the
  Debian project. 

* The [PINK](http://ibipio.hu/joomla/) image processing library. See also this
  link:
  [Pink documentation](https://perso.esiee.fr/~coupriem/Pink/doc/html/index.html).

This C/C++ library includes many algorithms in digital geometry, digital
topology and mathematical morphology.

* The [DGTAL](https://dgtal.org/) library, a powerful digital geometry
  library. This library in C++ 

![Mean curvature on the "dragon" shape](/files/portfolio/dragon512.png)

* The [Path Openings](https://github.com/path-openings) operators repository. 

* My more [personal projects](https://github.com/hugues-talbot) on github.
